            I am a junior developer. After
            graduating highschool, I had signed up for summer classes at UCD to start
            my college path immediately. I spent a year studying there before
            transfering to ITT Technical Institue where I achieved my Bachelor
            of Computer Science. Once I was done with that, I took a course on 
            JavaScript programming for 7 full months where I recieved a certificate
            for fulfilling all the requirments of the course. During that time
            I was very fortunate to recieve an internship at Technologic West where
            I worked on a prjoect called PakoBots. My part on the project was to
            use Node.js BLE, ajax, and jQuery to connect movement and lights to 
            the robot through bluetooth. Once that was complete, I used Ionic and 
            Apache Cordova to be able to control the robot through a tablet and
            phone instead of just a computer. I am very passionate
            about learning new frameworks, tools and languages to be able to 
            code in. I love challenges but I am obsessed with solving the problems
            that come my way. Although I like to joke around and have fun, I 
            am a quick learner and take pride in my work.
